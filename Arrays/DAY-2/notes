question with simple method of forloop and was getting problem  thn i get to knew abt hashset with this
we can solve duplicate problem easily=======Hashset is datastructure  in java that stores unique elements(no duplicates allowed) 

its key points are:
=> no duplicates
=> doesn't maintain insertion order
=> fast operations : checkng if an element exist is very quick(O(1)-constant time)
